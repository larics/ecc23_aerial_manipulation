done: 
 - [x] Integrated joystick to control small(am_S) and large UAV(am_L) 
 - [x] Created simple world to test mbzirc aerial manipulation 
 - [x] Created simple modes of control for slower and faster object approach 
 - [x] Added gripper services for turning gripper on and off 
 - [x] Tested lifting of small objects of interest 

todo: 
 - [ ] Add upstream of mbzirc repo 
 - [ ] Estimate object position with ICP 
 - [ ] Create ICP ROS2 package 
 - [ ] Test output of ICP and create simple aerial servoing to navigate UAV to the obstacle (simple, yet efficient) 
 - [ ] Think of states for lifting object
 - [ ] Think of collaborative object lifting
